## "Just write it": easily generate portfolios, documentation, ...

*Stone* is a static website generator: it takes a template, a css
 stylesheet, the content itself written in a high-level formatting
 syntax, and generates the corresponding html pages.

 However, *Stone* isn't a generalistic one: its goal is to provide a
 very easy way to generate simple websites like a portfolio, or the
 pages of documentation for a small project. That is quite limitated,
 but *Stone* tries to be good at what it aims.

### First steps with *Stone*

So, let's generate our first *Stone*-based website!

First, install *Stone*:

    opam install stone


The `stone` program should now be available. Type `stone --help` to
have some explanations on how to use the binary. Let's start by
generating a default website:

    stone -i my-portfolio


This initializes a `my-portfolio` directory with a default project,
which consists in:
* A config file (`config.stone`), which holds the title of the
  website, the list of the pages to display in the title bar and other
  things;
* A `data` directory, which contains the template and the
  stylesheet. As long as you use the default theme, you won't need to
  modify them;
* A `pages` directory. This is where you put your content. In
  particular, you can put here files written in
  [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
  syntax, with extension `.md` or `.markdown`.

You can now tweak the `config.stone` a bit, write things in `pages`,
or just leave the default config. Finally, generate the html content:

    stone my-portfolio


A new directory has appeared: `site`. It contains the html pages,
generated by *Stone* from the markdown files. Any other file you put
in `pages` that *Stone* does not know how to pre-process will be
copied as-is in `site`. If you have a FTP access to a web server
somewhere, just upload on it the contents of `site`. You can also
directly browse its contents locally with your favorite browser.

### How to go further

* For a more complete example, this documentation is written thanks to
  *Stone*. You can look at the [sources](https://github.com/Armael/stone).
* Read the [specifications](specs.html) about the structure of the
  project, the templates and the relevant css properties, and make
  your own templates and themes.
