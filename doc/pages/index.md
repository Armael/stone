## "Just write it": easily generate portfolios, documentation, ...

*Stone* is a static website generator: it takes a template, a css
 stylesheet, the content itself written in a high-level formatting
 syntax, and generates the corresponding html pages.

*Stone* is limited by design: its goal is to provide a
very easy way to generate simple websites like a portfolio, or the
pages of documentation for a small project.

### First steps with *Stone*

So, let's generate our first *Stone*-based website!

First, install *Stone*:

```
opam install stone
```

The `stone` program should now be available. Type `stone --help` to
have some explanations on how to use the binary. Let's start by
generating a default website:

```
stone -i my-portfolio
```

This initializes a `my-portfolio` directory with a default project,
which consists in:
* A config file (`stone.toml`), which holds the title of the
  website, the list of the pages to display in the title bar and other
  things;
* A `templates` directory, which contains the template used for
  rendering the html pages from the markdown files;
* A `pages` directory. This is where you put your content. It has
  been initialized with an `index.md` file and a CSS stylesheet.
  By default (see the rule inserted in your `stone.toml`), markdown
  files are rendered to html, and other files are copied as-is. 

You can now tweak the `stone.toml` a bit, write things in the 
`pages` directory, or just leave the default config. 
Finally, generate the html content:

```
stone my-portfolio
```

A new directory has appeared: `site`. It contains the content
generated by *Stone* from the files in `pages`. If you have a FTP 
access to a web server somewhere, just upload on it the contents 
of `site`. You can also directly browse its contents locally with 
your favorite browser.

When editing your website further, you can ask stone to continuously rebuild the
site as soon as a page changed:

```
stone -w my-portfolio
```

### How to go further

- For a more complete example, this documentation is written thanks to
  *Stone*. You can look at the [sources](https://github.com/Armael/stone).
- Read the [specifications](Specs.html) documenting the structure of the
  project, content processing rules and templates.
