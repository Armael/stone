# The key is the title of the page, the value is the path to the page

# The page title is also passed as $PAGE_TITLE$ to the template.

# A default preprocessor rule for markdown content.
# Converts .md files to .html files using a builtin markdown engine,
# and inserts the result in the provided template.

# Uses the builtin markdown engine, see "custom rules" for other kinds.

# A pattern that will be matched against source files. Only files
# that match this pattern will be processed by the rule.

# The pattern for the output filename. Must only use variables that were
# first matched by the source pattern.
target = "$(base).html"
# Path to a file in the template/ directory to use as template.
# The preprocessed contents will be inserted as $CONTENT$ in the template.
# Optional. If absent, the preprocessed contents will be output as-is.

# Custom rules.
#
# It is possible to specify custom preprocessing rules to handle
# other kind of contents.
# If several rules match for a given input file, they are all applied
# in definition order.
# If no rule matches, the file is copied as is.
#
# The main way to define a custom rule is to use kind = "external_command".
# Then, one can specify a 'command' which will be run in the shell.
# The command can use the $(source) variable to refer to the input file,
# and must write its output on the standard output. (It must not write
# on the filesystem (except in /tmp)).
#
# Examples:
#
# Process .adoc files using the asciidoc command to turn them into html,
# then insert them in a custom template.
#
# [[rules]]
# kind = "external_command"
# source = "$(base).adoc"
# target = "$(base).html"
# template = "asciidoc-template.html"
# command = "asciidoc -b html -s -o - $(source)"
#
# Include .embed.html files in the default template as-is.
#
# [[rules]]
# kind = "external_command"
# source = "$(base).embed.html"
# target = "$(base).html"
# template = "template.html"
# command = "cat $(source)"
