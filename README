Stone
=====

To build Stone, you need ocaml and the following dependancies :

- config-file
- cow

It is highly recommended to install them from the ocamlpro's Opam
package manager (http://opam.ocamlpro.com/).

Then, just run `make` to build stone's binary, so you can build the
complete html documentation by typing `./stone doc/`.

Now, just open the doc/site/index.html page with your favorite web
browser !
